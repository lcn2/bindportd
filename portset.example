# We bind to certain tcp & udp ports with bindport right after the network
# is started so that applications will not accidentally pick them. We use
# the bindport tool grabs and holds on to ports that are often the subject
# of system crackers and other network attacks.
#
# Even if you are behind router, packet filter or ipchain control where the
# inbound and/or outbound packets to certain ports are blocked, system and
# user applications may still try to bind to these ports. If your application
# is unlucky enough to pick one if these blocked ports, it will appear that
# the network is dead or non-responsive.
#
# Applications may try to bind to blocks ports perfect valid reasons.
# It is perfectly reasonable for a program to use almost any random unused
# privileged port. In fact there are facilities where an application
# will ask for any random, unprivileged and unused port on which to listen
# or make connections. Such applications have no way of knowing that the
# router/packet filter/ipchain will block them.
#
# WARNING: The port list below may not be complete. It may also contain
# services that you want to use. Adjust to suit your needs.

#	There are a few services which I do allow connections from these
#	ports. These are limited to services which I offer publically and
#	which have been hardened / run in a protected chrooted zone. These
#	include www (via Boa), https (via Apache), and smtp (via Postfix).
#	I do this because legit users can, for example, connect to my web
#	with a TCP/IP stream where the source post just happens to be a
#	port number used by system crackers.
#
#	For most other services, I refuse connections from these ports.
#	And of course, I refuse connections to these ports on my side. :-)

# To make this look cleaner, sort the block below this comment using:
